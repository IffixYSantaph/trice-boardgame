## Setup
1. Place the card between the two players
1. Each player rolls 6 dice, the player with most 6's is the first player; in case of tie, with most 5s, 4s...
1. The second player chooses a die for the first player, __don't change the dice values.__
1. The first player becomes the Active Player.

## Game Flow
The active player places the dice chosen by the opponent in a free square in the card. There are no other placement restrictions. After placement if a _tris_ is created the player who placed the last die wins the game instantly.  
If the game is not ended the player that has placed the dice choose another dice for the opponent and a new turn begin.

## End of the game
When a player make a _tris_ on the board the game will end immediately and the player who placed the last die wins.

## _Tris_
A _tris_ is composed by three dice horizontally, vertically or diagonally aligned with __any__ one of these three conditions:
* same color
* same value
* series of adjacent values (e.g. 2, 3, 4)
